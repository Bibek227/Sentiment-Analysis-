# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project performs sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It classifies text based on emotions and visualizes the results. The project processes text data, removes unnecessary words (stop words), maps words to emotions, and plots the results in a bar chart.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a popular NLP technique that determines whether the sentiment of a given text is positive, negative, or neutral. This project extends that idea to detect specific emotions based on a predefined lexicon of words and their associated emotions. It also provides a visual representation of the emotion distribution.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation, and tokenize words.
- **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminate common words that do not add meaning.
- **Emotion Detection**: Map words to emotions using an external `emotions.txt` file.
- **Visualization**: Create a bar chart showing the frequency of each emotion.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for implementation.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation (optional).
